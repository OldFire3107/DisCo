# DisCo

This is the code repository for distance correlation (DisCo) for decorrelation in ML training. It has been modified from the orignal. See [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05310] for details.

The change now matches the behavior of the `dcor` python package with all weights set to 1.0.

Disco.py has the implementation for PyTorch, Disco_tf.py for tensorflow.
